# UnitConverter

Thanks for taking a look at my Unit Converter for CCExtractor!

You can use it in three ways:

- User Prompt: Just call the `main()` method of `UnitConverter` with no method parameters

- From Method Call: Call the `main()` method of `UnitConverter` with method parameters like so:  `main(number of source units, source unit, target unit)`

- From command-line: Include the parameters when using `unitConverter.py` like so: `python unitconverter.py 1 m cm`

## Supports:

If the conversion table includes the required conversions, this unit converter can handle:

- [x] Basic Conversion
- [x] Complex Conversion

## Testing:

This was the first time I wrote tests for python!

My tests are all in the tests/ folder. I tried to make comprehensive tests but I'd really appreciate it if you could leave feedback on how to make better tests!
